1.General Information :- Traffic incidents, often leading to congestion, injuries, and fatalities, are a significant urban challenge, especially in densely populated cities like Chicago. Understanding the patterns and causes of these incidents is crucial for effective urban planning and traffic management. This study focuses on an in-depth analysis of traffic incident data in Chicago from 2019 to 2022, aiming to identify key patterns, temporal trends, and geographic hotspots of these occurrences.

This study embarked on a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling of traffic incident data in Chicago spanning from 2019 to 2022. The project aimed to unveil patterns and critical insights into traffic incidents, focusing on crash frequencies, temporal distributions, and geographical hotspots. Utilizing the "Traffic_Crashes_2019-2022.csv" dataset, which compiles reported traffic crashes, the analysis delved into various aspects including date and time, location specifics, crash details, and contributing factors. Employing an array of predictive models, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the study successfully differentiated between actual crashes and non-crashes with commendable precision. This was particularly instrumental in identifying areas with high crash risks. The findings from this study are pivotal for urban planning and traffic management strategies in Chicago, offering a data-driven foundation for informed decision-making and policy development. Furthermore, the successful application of predictive modeling paves the way for future research and applications in traffic incident analysis and urban safety enhancement.



2.Algorithms Used :- 
In the first phase, Our approach was twofold: First, we conducted a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the underlying structure and trends within the data. This EDA helped in unveiling critical insights such as peak times for traffic incidents, areas with higher crash frequencies, and common factors contributing to these incidents.

In the second phase, we leveraged predictive modeling techniques, including ** Logistic Regression **, ** SVM **, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, to build models that can effectively distinguish between actual crashes and non-crash incidents. The rationale behind this approach was to enhance the precision of identifying high-risk areas for traffic incidents, thereby aiding in preventive urban planning and policy-making.

This study not only provides a comprehensive analysis of traffic incidents in Chicago but also showcases the potential of data-driven approaches in addressing urban challenges. By leveraging advanced analytics and modeling techniques, we aim to contribute to the development of smarter, safer urban
